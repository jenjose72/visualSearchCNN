# Summary of Changes - Visual Search CNN

## What Was Changed

### FROM: MNIST Digit Recognition (10 classes, ubyte files)
### TO: Product Image Classification (4 classes, image files)

---

## Files Modified

### Sequential Implementation
1. **Sequential/Main.cpp**
   - Removed MNIST loader includes
   - Added image_loader.h
   - Changed from 10 output classes to 4
   - Updated loaddata() function to use custom image loader
   - Updated all class references from 10 to 4

2. **Sequential/layer.h**
   - Modified fp_preact_f() to accept variable num_outputs
   - Modified fp_bias_f() to accept variable num_outputs
   - Modified bp_weight_f() to accept variable num_outputs
   - Modified bp_bias_f() to accept variable num_outputs
   - Modified bp_output_s1() to accept variable num_outputs
   - All functions now work with flexible output sizes

### OpenMP Implementation
1. **Openmp/Main.cpp**
   - Same changes as Sequential/Main.cpp
   - Maintains OpenMP parallelization features

2. **Openmp/layer.h**
   - Same changes as Sequential/layer.h
   - Keeps all #pragma omp directives for parallelization

### New Files Created
1. **Sequential/image_loader.h** - Custom image loading system
2. **Sequential/stb_image.h** - STB image loading library
3. **Sequential/stb_image_resize2.h** - STB image resizing library
4. **Openmp/image_loader.h** - Copy of image loader for OpenMP
5. **Openmp/stb_image.h** - Copy for OpenMP
6. **Openmp/stb_image_resize2.h** - Copy for OpenMP
7. **README.md** - Project documentation
8. **COMPILE.md** - Compilation instructions

## Network Architecture Changes

### Before (MNIST):
- Input: 28x28 grayscale images
- Output: 10 classes (digits 0-9)
- Layer structure: `Layer l_f(6*6*6, 10, 10);`

### After (Product Images):
- Input: 28x28 grayscale images (resized from various formats)
- Output: 4 classes (Belts, Keyboard, Shoes, Watch)
- Layer structure: `Layer l_f(6*6*6, 4, 4);`

---

## Dataset Information

**Location:** `data/` folder with 4 subdirectories

**Categories:**
- Belts: 209 images
- Keyboard: 269 images  
- Shoes: 263 images
- Watch: 197 images
- **Total: 938 images**

**Split:**
- Training: 80% (~750 images)
- Testing: 20% (~188 images)

**Supported Formats:**
- JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- PNG (.png)
- WebP (.webp)

---

## How It Works Now

1. **Image Loading:**
   - Scans all 4 category folders
   - Loads images in any supported format
   - Converts to grayscale
   - Resizes to 28x28 pixels
   - Normalizes values to [0, 1]

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - Shuffles all images randomly
   - Splits 80/20 into train/test sets
   - Assigns labels: 0=Belts, 1=Keyboard, 2=Shoes, 3=Watch

3. **Training:**
   - Same CNN architecture (Conv -> Pool -> Fully Connected)
   - Same backpropagation algorithm
   - Same gradient descent optimization
   - Just adapted for 4 classes instead of 10

4. **Testing:**
   - Classifies test images
   - Reports accuracy/error rate

## Key Features

âœ… Supports multiple image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
âœ… Automatic image preprocessing (resize, grayscale, normalize)
âœ… Automatic train/test split with shuffling
âœ… Works with both Sequential and OpenMP versions
âœ… Flexible architecture (easy to add more categories)
âœ… No changes needed to core CNN logic

## No Changes to MNIST Files

The original MNIST .ubyte files in the data folder are **not used anymore** but were left in place. They can be safely deleted if desired:
- data/train-images.idx3-ubyte
- data/train-labels.idx1-ubyte
- data/t10k-images.idx3-ubyte
- data/t10k-labels.idx1-ubyte

---

## Next Steps to Use

1. Navigate to Sequential or Openmp folder
2. Compile with g++ (see COMPILE.md)
3. Run from project root directory (where data/ folder is)
4. Program will automatically load images and train

**That's it! The CNN is now ready to classify your custom product images!** ðŸŽ‰
